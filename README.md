### 👋 Hi there
I'm Michael Webb, more commonly known as Byte of Melon/TheRandomMelon online. I've programmed various things for several years now, especially when I get bored. You can check out some of the public ones listed on my profile if you want, or a list of significant projects:

🎵 [**OpenTurntable**](https://github.com/TheRandomMelon/OpenTurntable) - A (hopefully good) open source, cross-platform music player. Made with [Wails](https://wails.io) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com).

🎮 [**GameByte**](https://github.com/ByteOfMelon/GameByte) - A WIP research Game Boy emulator made in C++ with SDL3. It's pretty buggy and only plays Tetris, but I still find it cool!

🍦 **Vanillo** - Video made simple. - Not a public repo, but something I'm working on -> [Join the Discord](https://discord.vanillo.tv) or [Follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/VanilloPR)

🌥️ [**Daydream Studio**](https://daydreamstudio.cc/) - A passionate game and software development group from around the U.S. that works to create games and services that you've been daydreaming about.
